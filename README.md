# Rideshare Demand Forecasting & Promotion Strategy

**Notebook:** `rideshare.ipynb`

## Project Overview

A full-cycle data science project to help rideshare companies boost user engagement and operational efficiency. Using historical rideshare data, weather, and time-based features, this project predicts ride demand and recommends optimal timings for targeted coupon promotions.

**Business Impact:**  
The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can inform smarter marketing campaigns—leading to higher coupon redemption and better resource planning.

## Machine Learning Workflow

- **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Explored and preprocessed ride, weather, and time-series data to uncover demand patterns and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created features from temporal data (hour, weekday, seasonality) and weather conditions to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:**  
  - Trained multiple models, including time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet), regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest), and classification (for demand surge periods).
  - Compared models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and classification accuracy.
- **Insights & Recommendations:**  
  - Identified high-impact periods for promotion.
  - Delivered actionable, data-backed recommendations for coupon deployment.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python:** End-to-end coding for data and modeling.
- **pandas, numpy:** Data manipulation and preparation.
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning, model selection, and evaluation.
- **matplotlib, seaborn:** Visualization of trends, patterns, and results.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Stepwise analysis, reproducibility, and sharing results.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `rideshare.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the notebook cells for the complete workflow: data prep → modeling → insights.
